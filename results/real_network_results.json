Entropy=0.99\nMarginal Entropy: Variable A is significantly 'simpler' (lower entropy) than B. In many causal structures, entropy increases from cause to effect due to noise accumulation.\nVariables appear to be categorical or ordinal.\n\n### Causal Mechanism Analysis\nWe tested two competing causal hypotheses by fitting models in both directions.\n\n**Hypothesis: A -> B**\n- Model Type: logistic_classifier\n- Classification Accuracy: 0.597\n- Conditional Entropy: 0.961 (Lower = Better predictability)\n- Mutual Information (X,Y): 0.021 (Higher = Stronger association)\n- Error Independence: **Low** (p-value=0.000). Prediction errors depend on the input, suggesting model misspecification.\n\n**Hypothesis: B -> A**\n- Model Type: logistic_classifier\n- Classification Accuracy: 0.937\n- Conditional Entropy: 0.309 (Lower = Better predictability)\n- Mutual Information (X,Y): 0.021 (Higher = Stronger association)\n- Error Independence: **Low** (p-value=0.000). Prediction errors depend on the input, suggesting model misspecification.\n\n### Comparative Analysis (Objective)\n- **Predictive Determinism (Conditional Entropy)**: A->B: 0.9610 vs B->A: 0.3093.\n  -> Direction B->A has **notably lower** conditional entropy (relative difference ~211%), meaning it reduces uncertainty more effectively.\n\n- **Error Independence Test**: A->B p-value: 0.0002 vs B->A p-value: 0.0000.\n  -> Interpretation: p-value > 0.05 suggests errors are independent of input (good model fit).\n  -> Both directions fail the independence test. The relationship may be more complex or confounded.\n\n- **Mutual Information**: A->B: 0.0208, B->A: 0.0208 (Average: 0.0208).\n  -> Note: MI(X,Y) should theoretically be symmetric.
