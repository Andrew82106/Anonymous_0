Prediction errors depend on the input, suggesting model misspecification.\n\n**Hypothesis: B -> A**\n- Model Type: logistic_classifier\n- Classification Accuracy: 0.650\n- Conditional Entropy: 0.934 (Lower = Better predictability)\n- Mutual Information (X,Y): 0.045 (Higher = Stronger association)\n- Error Independence: **High** (p-value=0.758). Prediction errors are independent of the input, suggesting a correct causal model.\n\n### Comparative Analysis (Objective)\n- **Predictive Determinism (Conditional Entropy)**: A->B: 0.9197 vs B->A: 0.9340.\n  -> The conditional entropies are nearly identical (relative difference < 5%). Both directions have similar predictive power.\n\n- **Error Independence Test**: A->B p-value: 0.0000 vs B->A p-value: 0.7584.\n  -> Interpretation: p-value > 0.05 suggests errors are independent of input (good model fit).\n  -> Direction B->A passes (p=0.7584), while A->B fails (p=0.0000). This asymmetry is a notable signal.\n\n- **Mutual Information**: A->B: 0.0453, B->A: 0.0453 (Average: 0.0453).\n  -> Note: MI(X,Y) should theoretically be symmetric.
